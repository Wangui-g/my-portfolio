## 🩺 **About Me**
  
- **Former med student turned AI healthcare disruptor** - Left the stethoscope behind to build diagnostic tools that outperform my old professors😌😌😌 (no hard feelings) ⚡
- **Bridging medicine & tech** - Creating clinical tools that actually work for frontline providers, not just look good in research papers 🏥→💻
- **Microbiology nerd** - Currently researching bacterial resistance patterns that keep ID docs up at night 🧫🔬
- **Believe in** - AI that augments (never replaces) clinician judgment + tech that reduces burnout, not adds to it

## 💥 **Featured Projects**

- **🚑 AI Triage Assistant** - "The intern that never sleeps"🥱😴❌

  Reduced unnecessary ER visits by 32% at safety-net hospitals using React Native + FHIR API. First to bake social determinants into triage algorithms (and survived 6 months 
  of surgeons' brutal feedback) ⚡😅

- **🦠 Antibiotic Resistance Predictor** -"Crystal Ball for Superbugs"🔮🐛🤭

  Analyzing 10K+ bacterial isolates with PyTorch to outsmart superbugs before they outsmart us. Currently being validated at 3 academic medical centers 🧫→🤖

- **📱 TeleTriage Mobile** - (looks like we don't have a pun for this one😅)

  Patient-facing app that cuts 40% of low-acuity calls from overwhelmed nurse lines. Combines symptom checker with live video triage (because 
  sometimes you really do need that human touch) 📲❤️
